# Text Mining with R

### Copom, FOMC and International Relations scripts

This repository contains a few text mining projects using tidytext in R. 

While the focus and original intent was to quantify Central Bank comunication sentiment, I found these newly discovered tools 
to be very useful in another application: Discourse Analysis in International Relations. It is not my field of work or research, 
but I turned myself to it to contribute with a Vida (2025) paper. 

All scripts were made with help from AI to initially structure the code, specifically Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5. 
All qualitative stuff (like personalized lexicon, categories and weights) were not. 

I hope these scripts can be useful as a starting point for other projects :)

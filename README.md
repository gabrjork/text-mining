first, run the script to download the minutes. 
it will create an "atas" folder in your directory in which will be saved minutes ranging from a customizable period.
that script uses webscraping in order to retrieve the minutes.

then, the other script uses tidytext to read, tokenize and evaluate the minutes' stance using a Loughram lexicon mixed with a personalized one.
this approach is heavily based in the BIS paper by Chong and Ho (2022) and the 2017 book by Julie Silge
